# multiscale
The LibMultiScale is a C++ parallel framework for the multiscale coupling methods dedicated to material simulations. This framework is designed with the form of a library providing an API which makes it possible to program coupled simulations. At the present time, stable implemented coupling method is based on Bridging Method from T. Belytschko and S. Xiao.
